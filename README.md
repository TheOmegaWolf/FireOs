 Hey Folks,
 This is a project that basically works on the Graphical UI framework
 Use Turbo C7 to Compile and View a mindboggling piece of work in C++
 
 Step 1: Install Turbo C7 2.1 Or Versions above
 Step 2: Place the .cpp file in the "C:\TC\BIN\" Folder (Might vary if installed in a different directory...But "\TC\BIN\" Stays same)
 Step 3: Place the .bmp files in the same Folder
 Step 4: In the Turbo C7 software, Go to Settings->Linker->Libraries and Check the Graphics Library
 Step 5: Compile and run the code...
 Step 6: Voila! You have yourself a proper workin OS made in C++
 
 Functionalities are Explained in The txt File uploaded
 
 Cheers,
 Akshay ;)
